            <b>Abstract:</b> Continuous monitoring of vital signs has become increasingly im-
            portant for digital healthcare and enhancing self-awareness. Wearable devices like smartwatches, earbuds, and rings are gaining
            widespread acceptance for health monitoring. However, two significant challenges remain: (i) the limited battery life of these devices
            makes them unsustainable for long-term use, and (ii) many older
            adults, who would benefit most from health monitoring, often face
            barriers due to limited digital literacy. To address these issues, we
            introduce BioPulse—a perpetual, patch form-factor device designed
            for continuous monitoring. BioPulse estimates key parameters for
            cardiac health such as heart rate, heart rate variability, and blood
            pressure. By utilising a sparse sampling algorithm alongside NFC-
            based energy transfer and communication, the system operates
            without a battery, achieving a 57.9% reduction in power consumption. The system demonstrates a mean absolute error of 5.6 mmHg
            for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and 4.5 mmHg for diastolic blood
            pressure (DBP) compared to the ground truth device. This combination ensures a more sustainable and accessible solution for vital
            signs monitoring
