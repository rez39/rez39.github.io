	<h3><span class="mini-header">Bio</span></h3>

	Rajashekar is a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the <a href="https://nus.edu.sg/">National University of Singapore</a>, advised by <a href="https://ambuj.se/">Prof. Ambuj Varshney</a>. 
	My research lies at the intersection of low-power wireless systems, embedded sensing, and mobile computing. 
	I am particularly interested in building energy-efficient communication architectures for embedded systems, with applications in health monitoring and ubiquitous IoT deployments. 
	Prior to joining NUS, I completed a Dual Degree (B.Tech + M.S. by Research) in Electronics and Communication Engineering from <a href="https://www.iiit.ac.in/">IIIT Hyderabad</a>, where I worked on IoT-based air pollution monitoring systems under the guidance of <a href="https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~sachin.c/">Prof. Sachin Chaudhari</a>. 
	I have industry experience as a Digital Design Engineer at Texas Instruments, where I worked on synthesis and timing analysis of SoCs in the SITARA family.
	I have also held research internships at Nokia Bell Labs, Cambridge, and the Neuromuscular Control & Biomechanics Lab at the University of Alberta, focusing on battery-free health sensing and wearable-based clinical activity monitoring, respectively.
